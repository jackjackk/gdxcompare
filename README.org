#+TITLE: gdxcompare
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil h:1

* Purpose

Tool to compare symbols in GAMS Data eXchange (GDX) files with time series data (with a ~t~ dimension which will be always shown in the x-axis).

* Usage
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python -m gdxcompare.gdxcompare [options] gdx1 gdx2 ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

- Symbols (variables, parameters) are listed on the left and are selected by left clicking.
- Set dependencies and corresponding elements are listed in adjacent columns. Set elements are selected via mouse hovering.
- The color of the cells indicate the relative variance across elements in a set, so that blue elements will exhibit smaller differences across GDXs than red elements.
- The time series of the queried data is shown on the right. A title reports the description of the selected symbol and the last element selected.
- Zooming is supported via horizontal or vertical mouse dragging. Mouse hovering provides details on the top right corner.
* Requirements

- Python (tested only with version 2.7).
- up-to-date [[http://www.numpy.org/%E2%80%8E][numpy]] module.
- up-to-date [[http://pandas.pydata.org/][pandas]] module.
- GAMS installation with the same architecture of Python (e.g. 32bit Python will work with 32bit GAMS).
- ~gdxcc.py~ in ~PYTHONPATH~ environment variable.

| -p PROF         | --profile=PROF        | Profile name, associated to a predefined combination of regex for filtering symbols [use a profile called ''frep'' by default, defined in ''compare.py'', which gives a subset of results that are usually looked in WITCH GDX results files] |

For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python -m gdxcompare.gdxcompare -sQ -rbau,ref -m20 results_bau.gdx results_ref.gdx
#+END_EXAMPLE

will compare symbols starting with ''Q'' of the two GDX files ''results_bau.gdx'' and ''results_ref.gdx'' in the current path, labelling them as ''bau'' and ''ref'', and showing results up to period 20.
