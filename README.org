#+TITLE: gdxcompare
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil h:1

* Purpose

Tool to compare symbols in GAMS Data eXchange (GDX) files with time series data (specifically integer indexed data).

* Usage

After installing the module, just call
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python -m gdxcompare [options] gdx1 gdx2 ...
#+END_EXAMPLE
An HTML page will open up, showing something similar to [[https://github.com/jackjackk/gdxcompare/blob/master/other/gdxcompare-screenshot.png][this screenshot]].
- Symbols (variables, parameters) are listed on the left and are selected by left clicking.
- Set dependencies and corresponding elements are listed in adjacent columns. Set elements are selected via mouse hovering.
- The color of the cells indicate the relative variance across elements in a set, so that blue elements will exhibit smaller differences across GDXs than red elements.
- The time series of the queried data is shown on the right. A title reports the description of the selected symbol and the last element selected. The time axis is identified as the first set with integer elements.
- Zooming is supported via horizontal or vertical mouse dragging. Mouse hovering provides details on the top right corner.

* Requirements

- Python (tested with Python 3.6).
- up-to-date [[http://www.numpy.org/%E2%80%8E][numpy]] module.
- up-to-date [[https://github.com/jackjackk/gdxpy][gdxpy]] (requires manual installation from github).

For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python -m gdxcompare -sQ -rbau,ref -m20 results_bau.gdx results_ref.gdx
#+END_EXAMPLE

will compare symbols starting with ~Q~ of the two GDX files ~results_bau.gdx~ and ~results_ref.gdx~ in the current path, labelling them as ~bau~ and ~ref~, and showing results up to period 20.
